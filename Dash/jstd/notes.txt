History
- HTML first version came out 1990 (Tim berners Lee)
- Hyper Text Markup Language
- made for marking up text
- what does it mean "mark up text"? for what purpose? (visual/ *audiable*)

Yahoo as a case study
- Basic site (1996) - no design - just list elements.
- Upgraded - tables - why tables? What happened?
- 2011 - no tables - but full of divs - the real joke
  
- Conclusion:
- we were never tought how to use HTML as a markup language
- we can today go back to use it as such - CSS is powerful enough
- There is no reason to break our heads on stuff like complex positioning - 
   TML/CSS are mostly simple
